String Slicing in Python - 
String slicing is a technique to extract a portion of a string using a colon (:) inside square brackets ([]). Python strings are immutable sequences of characters, and slicing allows you to create a new string that is a subset of the original.

string[start:stop:step]

start: The starting index of the slice (inclusive). Default is 0.
stop: The ending index of the slice (exclusive). Slicing goes up to but does not include this index.
step: The interval between characters in the slice. Default is 1.
