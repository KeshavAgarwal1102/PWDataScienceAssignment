        "# The Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "# The Diamond Problem occurs in object-oriented programming when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. The issue arises when both parent classes have methods or attributes with the same name, causing ambiguity when the child class tries to access them.\n",

        "# In this case, if B and C override a method or attribute from A, and D tries to access it, Python has to decide which method or attribute to call from B or C. This creates ambiguity because D can potentially access two versions of the same method (one from B and one from C), and it’s unclear which one should be used.\n",
